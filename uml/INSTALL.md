## hpp2plantuml

To gain some insight in the class structure of the C++ code in an alternative way, [hpp2plantuml](https://pypi.org/project/hpp2plantuml/) can be used. This tool generates PlantUML class diagrams from parsing only the C++ headers files. Install with `sudo pip3 install --upgrade hpp2plantuml` and `sudo apt-get install plantuml`. Run it with `./1-hpp2plantuml.sh` and see the output in the `plantuml` directory.
