# Grammar

This directory holds a grammar that describes the format of the dictionary and the affix files for the spell checker called Nuspell. The formats are backwards compatible with files made for Hunspell or MySpell.

The EBNF file can be uploaded to [Railroad Diagram Generator](http://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui) to generate the diagrams which are included in this directory. For ease of viewing on online on GitHub, locally in a browser or in a nother way, both the download as XHTML with embedded SVG graphics and HTML with linked PNG was used to add the diagrams in this directory.
