# Grammar

This directory holds a grammar that describes the format of the dictionary and the affix files for the spell checker called Nuspell. The formats are backwards compatible with files made for Hunspell or MySpell.

The [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) file can be uploaded to [Railroad Diagram Generator](http://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui) to generate the diagrams which are included in this directory. For ease of viewing, both the download as XHTML with embedded SVG graphics and HTML with linked PNG was used to add the diagrams in this directory. Note that viewing these files online on GitHub will not work and a download or git clone is needed.
